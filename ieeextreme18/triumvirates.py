# Triumvirates -> 18.8 of test cases passed
# Time limit: 1000 ms
# Memory limit: 512 MB
#
# You have a group of N friends, where N is a multiple of 3. Each friend is located at a 2D position
# given by their coordinates. The goal is to group them into triumvirates (groups of three friends).
# 
# We define the stability of a triumvirate as the difference between the longest and shortest 
# distances between any two members of the group.
#
# Standard Input:
# - The first line contains the integer N, the number of friends.
# - The next N lines contain two integers representing the coordinates of each friend,
#   listed from index 0 to index N-1.
#
# Standard Output:
# - The output should contain N/3 lines, each containing the indices of the points that form a group.
# - Each index from 0 to N-1 must be included in exactly one line.
#
# Scoring:
# - Your score for a test case is the sum of all the stabilities for all triumvirates.
# - The objective is to minimize the score, which represents the instability in the groupings.
# - Your performance on each test case will be evaluated relative to the best solution for that test case:
#   TestValue * (BestScore / YourScore), where BestScore is the lowest score achieved by any contestant.
#
# Constraints and Notes:
# - N â‰¤ 99,999.
# - Coordinates fit within signed 32-bit integers.
# - The best score for each test case is strictly greater than 0.
# - The time limit is the same for all programming languages.
